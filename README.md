Note: 
- We are actively working and updating this repo to incorporate more features and datasets.
- For those who want to play with the code, We will release a mini-dataset and release a stable version soon.


## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Latest [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [ZED SDK **2.0**](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/)
- [CUDA **8.0**](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- sudo apt-get install libopenexr-dev libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev libgtk2.0-dev libqt4-dev libopenni-dev libopenni2-dev libvtk6-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libflann-dev libcpprest-dev cmake libproj-dev
- [PCL **1.7.2**](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) installed with its visualization module
- [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin), get a release version 
- [ProtoBuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md)
- [OpenCV **3.1**](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) with [OpenCV_Contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib), get a releaser version from both



## Build the program
